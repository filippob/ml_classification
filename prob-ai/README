## Repository for the code generated and used within the PROB-AI research project (2025)


### Phase One

1. code to download sequence data from the NCBI archive (strain level)
2. calculate statistics on the downloaded sequence data to measure the quality of genome annotation
3. filter sequence data based on quality and additional criteria (e.g. confirmed probiotic strain)
